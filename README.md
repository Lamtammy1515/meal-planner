# Welcome to Meal Planner App
This single page application was made using Javascript on the frontend and Ruby on Rails on the backend. Meal-Planner was originally made for those who need help planning out their meals for the day. Users can either choose what they want for their meals or this application can actually randomize a whole meal for them.
